Hi
it's me, a little message for my future self. Or anyone who happen to pass by this file
"Don't let any pinch of arrogance smear inside your heart and your head. DO NOT, ever, look down on any people"
Always remember that life is like a roller coaster or like a round ball, you may in the top of the chain now but that won't last forever.
There is a stronger entity and power that able to turn the table, flip you upside down.
Always fill your head with humbleness and gratefulness but never, ever, look down and belitle someone.
