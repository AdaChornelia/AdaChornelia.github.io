Hi
it's me, a little message for my future self. Or anyone who happen to pass by this file
"Don't let any tiny of arrogance smear inside your heart and your head. DO NOT, ever, look down on any people"
Always remember that life is like a roller coaster or like a round ball, you may in the top of the chain now but that won't last forever.
There is a stronger entity and power that able to turn the table, flip you upside down.
Always fill your head with humbleness and gratefulness but never, ever, look down and belittle someone.
Someday, you may will be put in that position, always remember that there is always something, someone that can do better than you.

Maybe one day, when you age a little bit more older, you may experience some of incovenience.
If you are a nice people, people always be there to help you.
But if your personality is such a trash, maybe you will be leave alone.

When you cannot be of used anymore, when your health quality decrease, your worker will be easily replace you.
Nothing such a permanent thing in your current position
And so, always be a nice person.
Also, always be grateful for everything you experience today
Lastly, always offer hands to people you can help within your power
