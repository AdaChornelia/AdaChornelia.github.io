It's the last day of February.

Some reflection about what happen every month need to be made.
So, first, I may spend a lot of money for my own stuff.
And also lent some of money to Rahma, which, turn out that she got scammed and she spend (in total) of 15,5 million rupiah of my money
I actually have to admit that I hate how it happened, as I also need money to construct our house and it has to be delayed because of that.
And who knows how long can she pay me back in full.


Other than that, I spend the salary money to myself. I fixed my phone battery, spend some money on good food and I think I gain some weight.
I also buy some books, 4 books in total and I will stop there for this month and next month
Also buying a hand heater, because I always cold
Also I buy two necklace (because I love myself)

I send money back home too, which I think is enough for my mom and dad for one month
So, as March 1st, I have to recap where I spent my money and how should I manage it for the next month.,
